# testTeknosa
A project we prepared for the Software Quality and Testing course. In this project, we tested the website of a technology brand called Teknosa. You can find an automated price check using Java Selenium and the tests we conducted with Selenium WebDriver (some were deleted, but I will re-add them). Additionally, the project includes various black-box testing techniques we applied and our presentation (presentation.pptx).

Thank you in advance for your feedback!
